# CompilaCompiler
A basic compiler for an hypothetical langage named Compila

## Langage specifications 
- One and only one instruction per line
- Program always starts with "Strart_Program" and ends with "End_Program"
- A comment can only be contained in one line, and must start with "//."
- An instruction always ends with two semi-colons ";;"
- A string is, like C-langage, put between two quotes, *but* contains only letters, digits or an apostrophe, it is declared with the keyword "String".
